          <h3>What is the Developer Program?</h3>
          <p>In a nutshell, the Developer Program is a way for Dwarf Planet Games to manage its, few but many, arbitrary developers.</p>
          <h3>What is it for?</h3>
          <p>We would like to keep our idea that all good work should be rewarded equally. No big boss guys that make millions of dollars doind absolutely nothing while the little guy works hard for very little.</p>
          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>If a team of people make a game and it ends up making money this is what happens:<br/>
          1. A portion of the profit goes to a charity of the team's choice<br/>
          2. A portion of the profit goes back into Dwarf Planet Games. (to buy things like new software)<br/>
          3. Something happens among the team members called a royalty vote in which members will go through a list of all other team members and give them a number between 1 and ten.<br>
          4. Each person's royalty votes are added up to get a total number of royalty points.<br/>
          5. These royalty points are then all added together to get the team's royalty number.<br/>
          6. Each person is then given a percentage of the remain ing profit based on their royalty percentage.<br/>
